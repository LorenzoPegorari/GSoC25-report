## Project
**Developing a MOOSE-based Console for arbalest: a first step to merge arbalest and qged**

## Organization
BRL-CAD

## Mentors
Daniel Rossberg, Himanshu Sekhar Nayak

## Abstract
This project sets out to take the initial step in merging *BRL-CAD*'s two in-development GUIs: "*arbalest*" and "*qged*". The primary objective is to transfer *qged*'s sophisticated *GED* console, which works via low-level calls to *BRL-CAD*'s core libraries (such as *libged* and *librt*), into *arbalest*, while preserving the application's distinctive clean and easy-to-scale architecture. To support this endeavor, I will also expand *BRL-CAD*'s new lightweight, modular, object-oriented API, known as "*MOOSE*". In addition to these core tasks, I will tackle compatibility issues related to *arbalest*â€™s Qt widgets to ensure proper display across different OSs, as well as resolve various GUI-related bugs.
