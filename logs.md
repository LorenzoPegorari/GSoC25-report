# GSoC 2025 Daily Logs

- **Community Bonding Period**:
    - *05/08 Thu*: Discovered that my project got accepted! ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ‰
    - *05/09 Fri*: Dealt with all the GSoC-related bureaucratic stuff
    - *05/10 Sat*: Created [this repo](https://github.com/LorenzoPegorari/GSoC25-report) to share with my mentors what I am working / have worked on
    - *05/12 Mon*: Reverted the hacks done to create a personalized title bar and restored the "standard Qt" look (this code was only tested on Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS and no PR was made)
    - *05/13 Tue*: Started working on prototyping a basic CLI in order to try to identify possible issues that could arise (so that I can discuss them with the mentors before the Coding Period starts)
    - *05/14 Wed*: Participated in the "Welcome 2025 Contributor talk and Q&A" by the GSoC team
    - *05/15 Thu*: Kept working on the CLI prototype
    - *05/19 Mon*: Tried all day to build and compile brlcad, MOOSE and arbalest on Windows 11, but without any luck (for some reason arbalest cannot execute properly because it does not find `Qt6OpenGLWidgets`). Although, I think that I did spot a bug that can be easily solved: when compiling arbalest, I got the error `rpcndr.h: 'byte': ambiguous symbol` (this is a [known issue with Windows headers](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/93889)). To fix it, I simply removed the `using namespace std;` in `Utils.h`, and I then changed all the few instances where this statement was meaningful by manually adding `std::`. I will most likely do a PR regarding this later down the road
    - *05/20 Tue*: A storm caused a problem with my Internet Service Provider in my local area, so I basically didn't have Internet all day... I kept trying to build arbalest though, but with no success unfortunately
    - *05/22 Thu*: Internet got fixed finally. Also I kept working on the CLI prototype, particularly exploring how to use the already created QgConsole (in qtcad)
    - *05/23 Fri*: Worked on the CLI prototype
    - *05/25 Sun*: Started working on the new theme creator feature, focusing on how to make it so that themes can be changed at runtime (without closing and reopening the application)
    - *05/26 Mon*: Kept working on the new theme creator feature
    - *05/27 Tue*: Found a way to make it so that themes can change at runtime without restarting the application. I need to make it sure that it works correctly in all possible cases
    - *05/29 Thu*: Worked on the CLI prototype, focusing on the best way to bridge or reuse qtcad's Qt Widgets without breaching arbalest's clean and easy-to-scale implementation
    - *06/01 Sun*: Video chat with BRL-CAD's old and new GSoC contributors and mentors before the Coding Period officially begins
- **Coding Period (1st half)**:
    - Week 1:
        - *06/02 Mon*: Prepared 2 PRs that I will do after I can test them on Windows 11. Kept trying to build arbalest on Windows 11
        - *06/03 Tue*: Worked on fixing how arbalest themes appear on Linux. Kept trying to build arbalest on Windows 11
        - *06/04 Wed*: Finally built arbalest on Windows 11! Opened [this PR](https://github.com/BRL-CAD/arbalest/pull/59). Tested on Windows 11 the [PR](https://github.com/BRL-CAD/arbalest/pull/60) focused on restoring the "standard Qt" look for the title/menu bar
        - *06/05 Thu*: Worked on fixing how arbalest themes appear on Linux. Opened [this PR](https://github.com/BRL-CAD/arbalest/pull/60)
